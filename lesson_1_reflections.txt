How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    viewing a diff between two versions of a file show only the code which is changes and not the code which is same so I don't have to look the complete code of the file

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    Using history I can get an idea of what changes did what do the program so that I can take informed decesions

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    we must commit only after a logical fix not everytime

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    git is for saving commit for a program and one logical change can include more than one files

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    first cd to the repository then git log for info of all commits then git diff 1 2 to compare

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    we can checkout for prev versions if I messed with the main program

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    I want to try git for making programs myself and contributing to the open source community
