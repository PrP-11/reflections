What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history
organized? How would branches help?

branches are helpful if you want to add a new feature or for testing purposes than you can create a new brach from the master so that your changes doesn't break the master code or program

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

diagrams help us visualise when a brach emerged and how it grew different from the master after it was created

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in
the diagram the way we do?

the features added to both of them after their parent branch will merge to get a single branch.
we represent it in diagram to get an idea of which commits will be lost or which will merge after merging

What are the pros and cons of Git's automatic merging vs. always doing merges
manually?

automatic merging are useful if all the contributors are in proper sinc and in contact with each other otherwise conflicts can occur or a bug can be generated. On the other hand manual merging can take a lot of time but chances of bug or error will be less.
